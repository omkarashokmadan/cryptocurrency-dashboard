## About The App

A cryptocurrency dashboard is quite similar. A crypto dashboard is a
digital platform that lives on a website or an app (either desktop or
mobile). Its primary function is to track your cryptocurrency accounts
and coins and monitor their historical prices and current values so that
you can manage both your crypto assets and related financial plans
accordingly. The dashboard integrates with cryptocurrency exchanges or
trackers like CoinMarketCap through an API or other tool to update your
crypto assets in real-time.

## Approach

This was a capstone project built during AlmaBetter training. Project goals included using frontend technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

I was supposed to build a dashboard where the user can track coins through charts. I started this process by using the `create-vite-app` then adding `tailwind` ,`redux` and `axios`.

One of the main challenges i ran into was formatting and filtering the data without loosing the integrity of the data.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-redux, Axios, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `create-vite-app` boilerplate to minimize and speed up the initial setup and invest more time in diving into technologies.
